        "23. How does a probability distribution relate to the expected outcome of a random variable?\n",
        "- A probability distribution directly determines the expected outcome of a random variable, because it defines the likelihood of each possible value the variable can take. The expected value (or mean) is calculated using the values of the random variable and the probabilities assigned to them in the distribution."
